# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 I started by writing a list of locations I wanted to have, then a list of actions that would make sense for those locations, then some different endings so I'd have something to work twords. After that I opened up vs code and started making classes, mostly with empty methods. Then I started filling in the methods for the player class and as I was doing them I was like "oh i'll need such-and-such class for this to work" so I would make that class too. I tried to stay concious of using superclasses whenever possible to reduce my workload since I don't want to work with a team. 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 How to actually plan my code. This is the first time I've had a project big enough that actually writing out what I would need ahead of time felt worthwhile. In 110 Pablo was always like "PLAN BEFORE YOU CODE" but that always felt like busywork, why plan to make something that only takes like ~300 lines tops. It's faster to just write somthing and test it. But java is kind of a pain to test so it was worth it to make my little spreadsheet. 
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

 I was thinking about making a `world` class to store all the people and cars, and make the locations into actual classes rather than strings. but in the end decided that would be feature creep and too time consuming. Better to keep it simple.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
