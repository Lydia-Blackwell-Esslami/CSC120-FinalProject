                           ====The Basics==== 
                           Type commands into the terminal. You can go to nearby places by walking, but for further ones you will need to get in your car and drive.
                           Check your current condition using 'status' and your pockets using 'inventory'. Don't hesitate to 'look' aroud you if you are lost.
                           Keep an eye on the time of day and your bank balance. It is a good idea to go to work every day, but take time to explore the city too.
                           ====Working====
                           You are the owner of a small used car dealership. You will need to explore the city to find used cars you can buy, repair them, and sell them.
                           1: Looking for cars
                           The 'trailer park' is a good place to find inexpensive, broken down cars. There is a chance that you will also find rare and pricessless models buried in the weeds.
                           The 'suburbs' have many cars for sale as well, which are more expensive but require less restoration.
                           2: Negotiating
                           Every car, no matter how broken down, has value to its owner. If you can get the owner into a good mood before starting the negotiation, you will get a better price.
                           Your physical appearance is of great importance when interacting with people, so be sure to attend to your personal hygine each morning before work.
                           3: Repair
                           You should repair every car to a perfect condition before selling it. Cars are repaired in the 'repair shop'. 
                           The sale value of a car can be greatly increased by following consumer trends. You can check your email on your office computer for information about these.
                           4: Sale
                           Once you have repaired a car, go to the 'parking lot' to wait for customers. You will have to negotiate with the customers.
                           5: Employees
                           You can use your office computer to hire mechanics who can fix cars, saving you valuable time. Each mechanic has a unique skillset, however, every mechanic can be trained to do any task.
                           Mechanics are only able to do tasks they are proficient in. Once a mechanic is proficient in a skill, you can ask them to train other mechanics in that skill.
                           6: The Shop
                           You can use your office computer to purchase various upgrades for different parts of the shop. You should also check the garage supply closet regularly.
                           You can restock the garage at the 'auto parts store'. Be warned that any chemicals you buy there are toxic.
                           ====Daily Life====
                           Other than working, you must 'eat' and 'drink' the items in your inventory to sustain yourself. If you are hungry, it will take longer to complete most tasks.
                           You must go to the 'grocery store' periodically to buy food. You can also eat out at the 'diner'. 
                           If you see someone out in the world, do not be afraid to 'talk' to them. You can learn a lot of useful information this way.""");
